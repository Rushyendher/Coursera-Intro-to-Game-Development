# Coursera-Intro-to-Game-Development
This repository contains the 3 assignments done my me when I am taking this course in Coursera.  

https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development

The assets were provided by Coursera. But most of the code was written by me.

#Note
Since the Unity webplayer is depricated, I rebuild them in Standalone version

If you want to play game:

	Just clone or download to your local computer and open .exe file
else:

	Open the project using Unity 4 or above
